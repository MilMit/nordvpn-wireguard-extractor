# NordVPN WireGuard Config Extractor with QR

A lightweight Bash script that connects to multiple NordVPN servers in a given country using the NordLynx (WireGuard) protocol, extracts their WireGuard configuration, and generates ready-to-use `.conf` files along with terminal-displayed QR codes for mobile use.

```

## Usage

```bash
sudo bash extract-multiple.sh [2-letter COUNTRY CODE]
```

Example:

```bash
sudo bash extract-multiple.sh de  # Extracts 5 DE configs
